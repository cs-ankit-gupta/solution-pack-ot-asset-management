"Alert","","","","2022-12-30T06:31:50+00:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This event is generated when an unauthorized system attempts to write information to a PLC or other field device.
Modbus TCP is a protocol commonly used in SCADA and DCS networks for process control. The protocol does not provide authentication of the source of a command. Most SCADA/DCS networks have a limited number of control servers that should write information to a PLC. An adversary may attempt to corrupt a PLC or set in a state to negatively affect the process being controlled.
An attacker with IP connectivity to the PLC issues MODBUS write requests. This could change the configuration of the PLC, make the PLC interoperable, or send requests to actuators to change the state of the process being controlled.","","","","","","","","0","","","","","2023-01-03T09:23:38+00:00","","","PLC-12-S7-400, Network Switch - A23WE","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FortiSIEM","192.12.141.11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Modbus TCP - Unauthorized Read Request to PLC","","","","","Open","Low","","PLC","Awaiting Action","Awaiting Action","Improper disposal","No","","Indicator Extracted","","70a5157e-7096-42a1-ac02-8511fb88f14b","CS Admin","2023-01-03T09:23:37+00:00","CS Admin","2023-01-09T07:10:37+00:00","155","['PLC', 'OT - Specific']","","Default"
