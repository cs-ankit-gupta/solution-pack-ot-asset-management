        "description": "This scenario recreates the Stuxnet attack in form of series of point alerts received by FortiSOAR from FortISIEM.\n<br>\n\n*Stuxnet is a worm that targets Siemens S7 PLCs connected to Windows-based engineering workstations. It is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected\u00a0USB Flash drive, thus crossing any air gap. The worm then propagates across the network, scanning for\u00a0Siemens Step7\u00a0software on computers controlling a PLC. In the absence of either criterion, Stuxnet becomes dormant inside the computer. If both the conditions are fulfilled, Stuxnet introduces the infected rootkit onto the PLC and Step7 software, modifying the code and giving unexpected commands to the PLC while returning a loop of normal operation system values back to the users*\n<br>\n\nThe operation of the Stuxnet malware can be summarized, as follows: \n1. Stuxnet enters the network via an infected USB flash drive. \n2. Stuxnet searches for computers running industrial applications connected to Siemens Step7 PLCs in the network. \n3. Stuxnet tries to connect to a CnC server on the Internet to update itself. \n4. Stuxnet compromises (introduces infected rootlet) and modifies the code running on the targeted PLCs. \n5. Stuxnet reports back fake normal process control information to other PLCs and users, so that they do not know the real state of the process.",
